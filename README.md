Build status
------------

Travis is now used to lint various scripts in order to guarantee minimal coding standards.

Intent
------

This repository is intended to collect all scripts around OpenStack administration with RPC.
It has been converted into a standalone module to be compatible with RPC-O and increasingly
other products, R or ceph, to automate common maintenance and administrative tasks.

Operational scripts
-------------------

Most RPC OpenStack supports scripts are currently running outside of ansible and are stored
inside the playbooks/files folder.
Those scripts will be converted into individual Ansible tasks over time, when necessary.

### rpc-o-support

This folder currently collects all support scripts for active RPC-O products
RPC-R should be keept in a different once applicable due to the architectual differences.

### archive folder

The scripts listed inside the archive folder or for historical reasons keept in this folder until the
the product, it was intended to be used for, completely was removed from operations like RPC4 (probably never dies).


### Other content

Some scripts are still linked in on top level in order not to break existing processes
like rpc-support role of RPC-O until those gets updated



Requirements
------------

This module expect to be installed/applied on a working RPC OpenStack environment which does run a
supported product lifecycle (RPC-O currently)


Execution
----------------

    git clone https://github.com/rcbops/openstack-ops.git /opt/openstack-ops
    source /usr/local/bin/openstack-ansible.rc

    cd /opt/openstack-ops/playbooks; openstack-ansible main.yml
